# Smile

The **Smile** app helps people to get ready for **presentations** and **interview** with access to an iPhone and our app. It allows the user to practice a speech in front of his/her phone camera. Then, the app uses a **machine learning model** to see instances where the user is happy, angry, neutral or sad: the general emotions that a human goes through. Generally, people tend to be on the happy or neutral emotional state when presenting a good speech or when communicating effectively.
